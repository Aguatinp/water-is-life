      <h2>Water Is Life For Craighouse</h2>
      <p><em>By Round Square (ENVIRONMENTALISM)</em></p>
      <p>Craighouse School, in collaboration with the global educational network Round Square, is excited to propose a joint project with the organization <strong>WATERisLIFE</strong>. This initiative aims to raise awareness about the global water crisis and take meaningful action to support communities that lack access to clean and safe drinking water.</p>
      <p>Through this partnership, students from Craighouse and other Round Square schools will work together to design and implement activities that promote education, fundraising, and real-world impact. By combining our values of leadership, service, and international understanding with WATERisLIFEâ€™s mission and expertise, we hope to make a lasting difference in the lives of those affected by water scarcity.</p>
      <p>Together, we believe we can inspire change and contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate world.</p>
